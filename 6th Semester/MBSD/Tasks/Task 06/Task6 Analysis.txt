We need a delay of 1 sec = 1000 msec


65.535ms is the max delay we can create, so to attain a delay of 1000ms, we should create a delay
of 50ms and run it 20 times.

TMOD:

	Timer1		Timer0
     Gate C/T M1 M0  Gate C/T M1 M0
     0     0  0   0   0    0  0   1	(Hex= 1)

Timer 0: Used as Timer with mode 1
