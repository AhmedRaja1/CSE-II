LM35 Temperature sensor:
The LM35 temperature sensor can generate voltage for -55 °C to 155 °C.
It has 3 pins. Pin1 is connected to Vcc, Pin2 is connected to ground and Pin 3 is Vout pin, it generates voltage according to the temperature value.
The formula for Vout is:
		 		Vout = 10mV  x Temperature
For example if temperature is 30,
				Vout = 10mV x 30
				Vout = 300mV
Now this Vout value needs to be Converted to Digital value by ADC.
 
ADC: 
ADC is used for analog to digital conversion. It has an internal Clock which is 640KHz by default which gives us approximately 9700 samples per sec. But our task requires a sampling rate of 1K. The minimum internal clock value can be set to 100kHz which gives us 1237 sample/sec which is approximately equal to 1K. 

 
It has a Vin pin which is connected to Vout pin of LM35. The converted result is send to 
Dout(8-bits). The formula for Dout is:
			Dout = Vin/Step-size
Since we are getting Vin from LM35 so Vin = Vout(LM35) = 10mV x Temperature.
So, Dout becomes
		Dout = (10mV x Temperature)/Step-size.
Now we want step-size such that Dout = Temperature. So, our step-size should be 10mV
		Dout = (10mV x Temperature)/10mV
		Dout = Temperature
For step-size to be equal to 10mV, Vref/2 should be 1.28V.
Calculation: 		
			Vref/2 = 1.28
			Vref = 2.56
		Step-size = Vref/255
		Step-size = 2.56/255
		Step-size = 10mV
 
	 
This Dout is sent to P1 of 8051 microcontroller, if P1 is less than 10 or it is greater than 36 then we need to generate a sound of 100Hz with a duty cycle of 25%.
