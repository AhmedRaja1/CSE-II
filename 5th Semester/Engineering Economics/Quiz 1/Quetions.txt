Question 1:
Suppose after graduating from college, you apply for job at several firms. You get calls from two companies: Company A and Company B. 
Company A offers $20 / hour and Company B offers $15 / hour. 
Company A deducts 2% / hour from basic salary as training costs from fresh graduates for first 6 months and Company B offers 3% /hour of basic salary as travel allowance. 
The travelling costs for Company A are $25 and Company B are $35 daily. 
Both the companies have daily 8 hours work load but Company A includes the half hour lunch break in working hour 'while Company B does not. 
Which option will you choose in such scenario? Formulate the problem solution and analyze this problem using engineering economics analysis procedure. 
Develop consistent viewpoints and use common unit of measure for evaluation of alternates.

Question 2:
The management team of a small manufacturing company is under pressure to increase the profitability in order to get much needed 
loan from the bank to purchase a more modern pattern cutting machine worth $1,25,000. 
There are two possibilities under consideration: (i) To sell the old pattern cutting machine worth $50,000 
and sell the waste wood chips and shavings worth $1,500 and take loan from bank for the remaining amount to buy 
the modern pattern cutting machine. (ii) To renovate the old pattern cutting machine in $25,000 and 
sell it in $80,000 and take loan from bank for the remaining amount to buy the modern pattern cutting machine. 
Formulate the companyâ€™s problem and analyze this problem using engineering economics analysis procedure. 
What is the asset value for the company in both the cases? Also mention which principle (s) of Engineering Economics 
did you consider for making the decision?
